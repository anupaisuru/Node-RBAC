Role Based Access Control Backend

This project is a Node JS based backend application designed to implement secure role based access control (RBAC). It provides user authentication and authorization functionalities with access and refresh tokens to ensure secure session management.

Users can sign up, sign in, and log out, while authorized users can perform CRUD operations on tasks based on their assigned roles. All routes are protected against unauthorized access and authenticated using JWT tokens.

The system is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
